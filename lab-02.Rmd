## Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
plastic_waste <- read.csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

##  Warmup  
4 panes of RStudio include:  
1) source - where you write edit and save and R code  
2) console - can directly execute code here p.s. do not write here and expect it to save  
3) environment (contains envi, history, connections)- displays current projects  
4) output - displays outputs but also holds your file directory 

How many entries are in the dataset? (use view(filename) to see or click in envi pane)  
- 240 entries 

### Exercise 1
```{r waste_per_capita}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
```

Notice there is an extreme outlier on the right hand side of the graph. To determine which country this is, filter the data for countries where waste per capita is greater that 3.5kg/person

```{r waste_per_capita_filter}
plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)
```
1.1 Interpretation  
- Did not particularly expect this result - based on a quick google search Trinidad and Tobago appears to have a waste problem due to a variety of issues from high import volume, poor infrastructure, and limited land for landfills. Generally, many of the countries hover around 0.25 kg/person with a cluster falling below that and into the negative. 

```{r creating density plot}
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)
) +
  geom_density()
```
```{r coloring desity plot}
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density()
```
```{r color fill density plot}
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density()
```
```{r changing alpha}
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)
```

### Exercise 2
2.1 Lower alpha 
```{r altering alpha}
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2)
```

2.2 Why did we define color and fill of the curves via aesthetics but we defined alpha as a characteristic?  
Mapping vs setting  
- Mapping is a characteristic that is based on values of a variable in the data set (goes into aesthetics) - in our case color and fill are based on continent  
- Settings of points are not based on values pertaining to variables in the dataset (can go into geom_*) - in our case transparency is not tied directly to the dataset, rather it is a tool for visualization purposes 

### Exercise 3
Another way to visualize - side-by-side box plots 
```{r}
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = continent,
    y = plastic_waste_per_cap
  )
) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r plastic waste violin}
ggplot(plastic_waste, aes(x= continent, y= plastic_waste_per_cap)) + geom_violin()
```
  
3.1 Violin plots vs boxplots  
- Violin plots better show the distribution of our data, specifically the density. Whereas, boxplots better show summary statistics such as the median, quartiles, and outliers.

```{r plastic-waste-mismanaged}
ggplot(plastic_waste, aes(y = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap, x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) + geom_point()
```

```{r plastic-waste-mismanaged}
ggplot(plastic_waste, aes(x = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap, y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) + geom_point()
```

4.1 Describing relationship between plastic waste per capita and mismanaged waste  
- The relationship between plastic waste and mismanged waste is slightly positive and linear 

```{r plastic-waste-mismanaged-continent}
ggplot(plastic_waste, aes(x = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap, y = plastic_waste_per_cap, colour = continent)) + geom_point()
```

4.2  
- Countries in Europe tend to have the lowest plastic waste per capita and the most well managed waste per capita.   
- One country in North America has poor waste management and a high level of waste per capital. Otherwise, most coutntries in North America are clustered.  
- Countries of Africa, Oceana, and South America appear to have the most variable relationships. Patterning may be related to development of country. 

```{r plastic-waste-population-total}
ggplot(plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, y = total_pop)) + geom_point()
```


```{r plastic-waste-population-coastal}
ggplot(plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, y = coastal_pop)) + geom_point()
```

4.3  
- Neither of these pairs of variables appear to be more strongly linearly associated than the other. However, if I had to choose, I would say that the coastal population plot is likely more linear due to an higher number of outliers.
